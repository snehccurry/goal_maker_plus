# keep in mind.

1) make sure it checks if the person has a plan before the next day starts, and if he didn't have any plans then ask on restart.

2) Keep reminding user of time left for the current task and upcoming task is in how many minutes.

3) keep asking user if they have something on their mind that they can add/ add as a goal.

4) motivate them by showing them how much they have achieved of their goals. like weekly, in a week, and 3 days goals as well

5) analyze with AI where he/she spends a lot of time and what he/she likes,

6) understand their habits and help them with a local AI (not mandatory tho). and collect nobody's data.

7) remember we are here to help! and so yes you don't forget your way, you too have to enjoy life and help! let's make it happen!
